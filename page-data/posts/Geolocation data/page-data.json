The general research scope focused on formal and mathematical models for data processing, as well as on issues concerning the engineering of large-scale data processing systems.The greatest technical goal at this project have been the application of data-driven approaches to extract information from satellite. An important part of my work consisted of the devising novel methods to statistically learn about patterns of life of any defined and observed area, and how it changes over time. Generally speaking, the tasks consisted in the revision of methods for analysis geolocating and longitudinal data, in particular on anomaly detection and data fusion techniques. This partially includes trajectory reconstruction and spatio-temproral normalcy recognition for addressing today societal challenges. Deep learning algorithms were found well fitted into our analysis. I also found useful the DBSCAN algorithm in order to cluster different regions using instead, maritime data as AIS dataset. When task were intented to deal with commercial inputs (e.g. heatmap data visualisation demo), I’ve used eolearn, javascrpit and google maps API to portrait data into imagery layer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lessons-learned\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#lessons-learned\" aria-label=\"lessons learned permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Lessons learned</h2>\n<p>I personally learnt a vast amount of code sources (includes also data project management skills such tools and documentation work breakdown structure) and met people involved in such complex challenges from all around the world (European Space Agency - Copernicus Programme).
